Django Support
**************

Django support has been added to this project.  A revised
requirements.txt file has been included in this change.

Files and Directories
#####################

    -   manage.py - this script has been added to the main
        directory to run the Django server in development mode.
        Production will use a different arrangement.

    -   FPIDjango directory - This directory contains all the
        Django code, settings, and configuration files.  All of
        the "front-end" code will live in subdirectories of this
        directory.

How to Run
##########

#.  Create a new run configuration

    -   Name - Call it whatever you want, e.g. "Run Django Server".

    -   Parameters - "runserver localhost:<port>"  where
        <port> can be any number between 8000 and 9000.

    -   Environment varibles - add the environment variable
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE with the value FPIDjango.settings.

    -   Working directory - set to the work subdirectory.

    -   Add content roots to PYTHONPATH - Should be checked.

    -   Add source roots to PYTHONPATH - Should be checked.

#.  Save run configuration.

#.  Run it. If configured correctly, there will be messages in the Run tab
    about how it started and is accessable via a browser on localhost at the
    port specified.

#.  Start a browser and go to the port indicated.  There should be a
    Django page displayed.

Using Django's Authentication
#############################

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/ covers the basic
usage of the authentication.  We want to limit most views to logged in
users only.  To do that we use the LoginRequiredMixin in our view classes.
i.e. (from the Django documentation)

::
    
    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
    
    class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
        login_url = '/login/'
        redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'
    
If we want to limit access to a specific subset of users (i.e. only certain
users may edit BoxTypes) we can do that with the PermissionRequiredMixin.
i.e.:

::
    
    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin
    
    class EditBoxTypesView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
        permission_required = 'boxtype.can_edit'
        # Or multiple of permissions:
        permission_required = ('boxtype.can_delete', 'boxtype.can_edit')
    
Pro Tip: It makes life easier to grant permissions to groups rather than to
individual users.

If those methods don't cover a specific need the UserPassesTestMixin may be
used.  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.mixins.UserPassesTestMixin
