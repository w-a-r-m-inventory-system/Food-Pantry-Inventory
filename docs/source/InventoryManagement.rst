.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/CheckinBox_0_01_26.png


The first two items to enter are the **Box number** and **Product**. With the keyboard

You will have to select 3 different entries with your mouse.

    (1) Row number
    (2) Bin number ( Bin number in the length of a row)
    (3) Tier number (level up or down

Each entry uses a drop down list and you will make a choice from each drop down list.
In the graphic below the **Row** and **Bin** numbers have been chosen and the drop down
list is shown with the **Tier** number.

it is not necessary to fill these fields out. These drop down lists show a list of all
the months in the year. You can also choose to **only** fill out the **Exp month start**
field also. However if you choose to fill out the **Exp month end** field you must make
sure it is a later month in the year than the **Exp month start** field. So if you enter
**April** in the **Exp month start** field, then you must enter **May** or a later month
in the **Exp month end** field.

You will create the pallets location for ‘Row’, ‘Bin’ and ‘Tier’. Row refers to
which long row the pallet is on. Currently rows are 2 bins wide. Bin refers

Scan a Box Popup
=================

You will be directed to a **Scan a Box** popup window. If your computer has a
camera you will be asked to enter a QR code. QR is short for Quick Response and
is simply a funny looking label that can be read by computers.

Scan a Box QR code popup (for computers with a camera)
---------------------------------------------------------

Use the camera on your computer to scan the QR code as shown below. Some
computers may request your permission to use the computer camera. You will
have to agree to the camera permission request to scan the QR code. In the
image below an individual is holding a scan code up to the computer camera.
With the QR code in the center of the ‘Picture Window’ click on the blue
**Scan** button at the bottom right.

Occasionally there may be a situation where the computer is unable to scan the
QR code, due to poor lighting or some other technical issue. In that case you
can always add the QR code manually be entering or keying in the 5 digit box
number manually in the pop up window at the bottom left. Then click the blue
**Scan** button at the bottom right.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/QRCode2.png

Scan a Box popup (for computers without a camera)
--------------------------------------------------

On this page you first have to enter or key in a 5 digit box number in the
bottom left of the screen. You can enter any number but it must contain exactly
5 digits. Once you have entered the number click on the **Scan** button in the
bottom right of the popup window.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/ScanBoxPopUp.png

Return to Build Pallet
=======================

After clicking on the **Scan Button** you will be returned to the **Build Pallet**

white ‘X’ in a red box at the left of your screen. On this screen you will
select a product to go in the box from a drop down product list. Click on
the ‘Dropdown icon’ at the bottom right of the ‘Product’ rectangle’. Then
choose an item from the list.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/EnterProduct.png

Once you have entered the product, use the ‘Expiration Year’ drop down list
to enter the ‘Expiration Year’.

Entering the ‘Expiration Month’ is optional. Months are entered from a drop
down list that holds numbers from 1 to 12 that correspond to the months of
the year- January to December. If you do decide to enter the ‘Expiration Month’
please make sure that the ‘Start’ month **is always less than** the ‘End’
month. This means the ‘End’ month **must not equal** the 'Start' month and
**must be greater than** the ‘Start’ month. *Not all food items will have
an ‘Expiration Month’ with a ‘Start’ and an ‘End’ month.* Once you have
entered everything on this page the page should look similar to what is below.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/PalletCompleteBefore.png

From here if you click on **Scan a Box** you will be directed back to the
**Scan a Box** popup window. There you can add another box in the same
manner as you did before. If you click **Pallet Complete** you will be
directed to the **Pallet Complete** screen.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/PalletCompleteScanBoxButtons.png

Pallet Complete
================

You should now see the **Pallet Complete** screen.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/PalletCompleted.png

From here you can return to the main screen by clicking ‘Return to main page’.



Move a Pallet
**************

**Currently the Move Pallet screen has an error or bug in it. There is a link on
the Move Pallet screen which states 'Return to Manual Pallet Menu'. This link should
NOT be clicked and should be ignored. If you do not see this link then the bug has been
fixed but the User Documentation has not been updated.**

After clicking on **Move a Pallet** you should see a screen like the one below. This
screen allows you to move the location of each pallet along with its boxes in the
database records. Basically if you move a pallet you are also moving the boxes the pallet
contains.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/MovePalletStart_0_00_11.png

When moving a pallet (with its boxes) three different conditions can occur.

1. Move a pallet and its boxes to an empty pallet location.
#. Move a pallet and its boxes to non-empty pallet location.
#. Attempt to move an empty pallet with no boxes.

All three conditions will be shown below.

Move a Pallet to an Empty Pallet Location
==========================================

When moving a pallet and its boxes to a new location the first thing you need to
do is to "Enter location to move pallet from". You enter the position of the pallet
by selecting the Row, Bin, and Tier dropdown lists by using the mouse to click on the down
arrow at the right of each dropdown list. Selecting the down arrow as shown below in the
Row dropdown list brings a set of choices. Simply click on the current Row location choice
to "Enter the location to move pallet from".

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/SelectRowFromDropDownList_0_00_21.png

Do the same with the Row and Tier locations. Once that is done you should see the
**Move Pallet** screen as filled out below with Row, Bin, and Tier locations filled out.
Then click on the blue **Submit Query** button.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/SubmitQuery_0_00_23.png

This will bring you to a similar screen but this new screen will say "Enter location
to move pallet **to**". Enter the Row, Bin, and Tier location for where the pallet
and it's boxes will be moved to. The screen below shows the new Tier location being
chosen.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/SelectTierTo2_0_00_20.png

Once the **Enter location to move pallet to** screen has been filled out click on the
blue **Submit Query** button. If the new location you want to move the pallet is empty
and has no boxes you should see a screen similar to the one shown immediately below.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/MovePalletFinish_0_00_39.png

If the "Enter location to move pallet to" is NOT EMPTY then you will see a screen like
the one shown in the next section below.

Move a Pallet and Its Boxes to a Non-Empty Pallet Location
===========================================================

The screen below shows up when you try to move a pallet to a location where a pallet is
already located. Notice that the message states "There are 2 boxes at 01,03,C2".

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/BoxesAtLocation_0_01_21.png

This means you will have to make a decision, either (1) choose a new location by clicking
the **Change To Location** choice or (2) merge the pallets by clicking the **Merge Pallets**
choice.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/SelectOptionLocationMerge_0_01_30.png

If you click on **Change to Location** you will be directed back to the **Enter location
to move pallet to** screen as shown above. From there you can select another location to
move the pallet to.

If you click on **Merge Pallets** both pallets along with their boxes will be merged
into the new location you picked from the **Enter location to move pallet to** screen.
You will see a screen stating "boxes move to row, bin, tier".

Attempt to Move an Empty Pallet
================================

If you attempt "Enter location to move pallet from" and there are no boxes recorded
in the database for that pallet location you will see a screen similar to the one shown
below.

.. image:: InventoryManagementImages/MoveEmptyPallet_0_03_01.png
