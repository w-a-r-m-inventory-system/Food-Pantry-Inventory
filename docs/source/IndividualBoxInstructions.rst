it is not necessary to fill these fields out. These drop down lists show a list of all
the months in the year. You can also choose to **only** fill out the **Exp month start**
field also. However if you choose to fill out the **Exp month end** field you must make
sure it is a later month in the year than the **Exp month start** field. So if you enter
**April** in the **Exp month start** field, then you must enter **May** or a later month
in the **Exp month end** field.
