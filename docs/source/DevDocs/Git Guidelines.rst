Git Guidelines
**************

These guidelines are suggested for use with this repository.


Definitions
===========
Main Repository (on GitHub)
    The main repository is located on GitHub at
    https://github.com/w-a-r-m-inventory-system/Food-Pantry-Inventory.
    This repository is the ultimate target of all changes.  Currently it is
    managed by Shelby Elzinger.

Public Repository (on GitHub)
    This is **your** public repository.  It is also located on GitHub at an
    address something like
    https://github.com/userid/Food-Pantry-Inventory where userid is your
    GitHub user Id.

    This repository is where you will push all your changes before
    submitting a pull request for them to be applied to the main repository.

Personal Repository (on your computer)
    This repository is located on **your local hard drive** somewhere.  It is
    characterized by having a ".git" directory under the top directory.
    That top directory will be the "project" directory for your copy of the
    WARM inventory system.  Typically it will be the project directory for
    PyCharm.

    Your personal repository will be linked to both the main repository and
    your public repository.  Your personal repository will be the place you
    will create and test all changes before pushing them on.


Setting Up Your Working Environment
===================================

Setting Up Your Public Repository
---------------------------------

#.  If you have not already done so, go to GitHub.com and create a user Id
    for your self.

#.  Login to GitHub with your user Id and credentials.

#.  Go to https://github.com/w-a-r-m-inventory-system/Food-Pantry-Inventory.

#.  Click on the box that says "Fork" in the upper right corner of the web
    page.

    A.  This will create your public repository under your own area on GitHub.

#.  If this didn't switch you back to your area of GitHub, click on the icon
    in the far upper right of the public repository web page to show a
    dropdown of choices about your area of GitHub.  Click on the "Your
    repositories" choice.

#.  If not there already, click on your public repository labeled
    "Food-Pantry-Inventory".

#.  Click on the green "Clone or download" button.

#.  Click on the little clipboard icon to the right of the URL
    that begins "https://github.com/...".

    A.  This will copy the full URL to your clipboard.

#.  Save this URL somewhere.  You will need it to create your personal
    repository below.

#.  If you wish, you can go back to
    https://github.com/w-a-r-m-inventory-system/Food-Pantry-Inventory and
    click on the box that says "Watch".  This will notify you of changes
    made by other folks to the main repository.

Setting Up the PyCharm IDE
--------------------------

Our group has decided to all use PyCharm as our IDE for this project.
Either the Community Edition (which is free) or the Professional Edition is
fine.  After installing PyCharm, configure it as follows to provide support
for this project.

#.  Add these plugins:

    A.  .ignore

    #.  autodoc

    #.  Markdown Navigator

    #.  Codeglance (optional)

    #.  PlantUML Integration (optional)

    #.  String Manipulation (optional)

    #.  Database Navigator (Optional)

Setting Up Your Personal Repository
-----------------------------------


#.  Verify that you have the URL saved in step 9 above.

#.  Start PyCharm.  (If you have other projects open, please close them for
    the moment.)

#.  Choose "Checkout from Verson Control" from the right side of the dialog
    presentd by PyCharm.

#.  Paste the URL saved about into the URL box provided.

#.  Click on the "Test" button to verify that you have the correct URL to
    access your public repository on GitHub.

#.  Modify the value in the "Directory" box as needed and append
    "/Food-Pantry-Inventory" to it.

#.  Click on the "Clone" button to create your personal repository.

#.  Use PyCharm to establish a virtual environment for your personal
    repository.

#.  Add these libraries/packages to the virtual environment.

    A.  Sphinx - used for documentation

    #.  sphinxcontrib-plantuml - used by Sphinx to include UML
        diagrams (created by PlantUML) in the Sphinx-generated documentation.

    #.  Pytest - used for testing - expecially TDD

    #.  PyYAML - used for managing configuration files

    #.  Django - used for web part of project

#.  From the command line (either an external command prompt or using
    "Terminal" within PyCharm enter the following:

    ::

        git remote -v

#.  Verify  that there are two lines for "origin", that both point to your
    public repository, and that the first line has "(fetch)" while the
    second has "(push)" at the end.

#.  Enter the following commands to allow git to pull changes from the main
    repository.

    ::

        git remote add original https://github.com/w-a-r-m-inventory-system/Food-Pantry-Inventory.git
        git remote -v

#.  Now you should see four lines.  The first two are the same as before.
    The third and fourth lines should begin with "original" and the URL
    should be for the main repository.

    A.  The label "original" is arbitrary.  The following sections that
        discuss git and GitHub operations assume that "original" has been set
        this way.

#.  Install graphviz from https://graphviz.org/.  This is needed for PlantUML.

Git and GitHub Operations For Our Project
=========================================

Make Local Changes
------------------

#.  Verify or set PyCharm to the master branch (should be in the very bottom right corner).

#.  Create a new branch with a name you substitute for <newbranchname> below (can be done
    manually in bottom right corner or in the terminal).

    ::

        git branch <newbranchname>

#.  Make the new branch active for changes.

    ::

        git checkout <newbranchname>

#.  Make whatever changes you wish to make.

#.  If you haven't added new files to your personal repository any other
    way, add each file by highlighting it and using the menu
    **VCS -> Git -> Add**.

#.  Commit the changes to the git branch by clicking on the project
    folder (Food-Pantry-Inventory) and using the menu
    **VCS -> Git -> Commit Directory...** to bring up the commit
    dialog.

#.  Add a commit mesage.

    #.  The first line should be a summary of the change and be less than 72
        characters long.

    #.  The second line should be blank.

    #.  The third and subsequent lines should describe the details of what
        changed, e.g. files added, changed, or deleted and why.

    #.  Change other areas of the commit dialog as needed.

    #.  Click on the "Commit" button.

#.  Repeat as often as needed until your change is ready to be submitted to
    the main repository.

#.  Change back to the master branch with PyCharm or by typing in the
    terminal command area:

    ::

        git checkout master

#.  Merge the new branch into the master branch by typing:

    ::

        git merge <newbranchname>

#.  Now that the branch has been merged back into the master, the branch
    name can be discarded by typing:

    ::

        git branch -d <newbranchname>

Pushing Changes To Your Public Repository On GitHub
---------------------------------------------------

#.  Make changes as noted above.  Be sure that you have merged your changes
    back into the master branch.

#.  If you have not already done so, switch back to the master branch.

#.  Enter the following command in the terminal command area:

    ::

        git push

    #.  This applies the change to your public repository so others can see
        those changes.

#.  Verify that your public repository on GitHub has been updated by
    checking the web page for your repository.  It should now say that your
    repository is now one (or more) commits ahead of the main branch.

Creating A Pull Request To The Main Repository
----------------------------------------------

#.  After making a change (or a set of changes), committing them to the
    master branch and pushing the changes to your public repository, verify
    that all files and changes to files are reflected in your public
    repository.

#.  Log in to GitHub and go to your public repository.

#.  Click on the "New Pull Request" button.

#.  GitHub verifies that the changes can be applied to the main repository.

    A.  GitHub checks for conflicts, a common ancestor starting point, etc.

#.  If GitHub allows the pull request to procede, a green "Create pull
    request" button will be available on the web page.

#.  Fill in a meaningful title and comments about why this pull request should
    be incorporated into the main repository, what issue(s) it resolves, etc.

    #.  Markdown can be used in your comments.  To see what GitHub allows for
        markdown see
        https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.

#.  Click on the green "Create pull request" button.

#.  Send an email to Shelby that you have submitted a pull request.

Update Your Public Repository To Match The Main Repository (both On GitHub)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#.  Verify that your public repository says that it is one (or more) commits
    behind the main repository.

#.  Commit any changes you have outstanding to your current (non-master)
    branch.

#.  Switch to the master branch.

#.  Issue the following from the Terminal window or do the equvalent from
    PyCharm.

    ::

        git pull original master

        git push

    #.  The first command identifies the changes between the main repository
        and your personal master branch.  It then automatically commits those
        changes to your personal repository.

    #.  The second command pushs those same changes up to your public
        repository.
