"""
settings_private.py - Shadow or pseudo-private file.

This file has dummy settings in it.  The purpose is to show the format of
your real settings_private file in the private subdirectory.

The files at this level are dummy files that are safe to upload to GitHub.
The equivalent files in the private subdirectory are ignored by git so it
is safe to put your sensitive (and really private) parameters in those files.

When you run Django on your system for real, change the environment
variable for DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE from FPIDjango.settings to
FPIDjango.private.settings.
