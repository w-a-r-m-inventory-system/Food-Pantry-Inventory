# Food Pantry Inventory Tracking

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/food-pantry-inventory/badge/?version=latest)](https://food-pantry-inventory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Welcome to the Food Pantry Inventory open source project!

This project is designed to track the inventory in the warehouse of a food
pantry.  It tracks boxes of product by location (row, bin, and  tier), contents
(green beans, corn, etc.) and by expiration year.  The expiration can 
optionally be tracked by half-year, quarter, or arbitrary month ranges.

Details of this system are given in the documentation located at docs/source/index.rst.

# Quick Start Install

1.  Download the zip file for the master branch of this project.

2.  Unpack the zip file in a convenient directory.

3.  Create a python virtual environment for this project.

    e.g. virtualenv venv
    
4.  Install the various libraries needed.

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
5.  Note - this project defaults to using PostgreSQL.  If you choose to use
some other database, now would be a good time to install any additional
libraries to support it.

6.  Create a directory "./FPIDjango/private" and copy 
./FPIDjango/private_settings.py to ./FPIDjango/private/private_settings.py.

    Note that the .gitignore file is set to ignore anything in the 
    ./FPIDjango/private subdirectory.
    
7.  Create a database and start a server for it.  The tables in the database
will be created in a later step.  Make a note of the database name, the
 server access (host, port, etc.), and credentials for a user that can
  modify the schema for the database. 

8.  Modify ./FPIDjango/private/private_setting.py file to taste.

    a.  DB_ENGINE - set to the appropriate backend for your database.
    
    b.  DB_NAME - set to the database name to use for this project.
    
    c.  DB_USER - the user name from the credentials that can modify the
    schema for this database.
    
    d.  DB_PSWD - the password for the DB_USER above.
    
    e.  DB_HOST - the IP or URL to reach the database server.
    
    f.  DB_PORT - the port the server is using to listen for requests.
    
    g.  MY_SECRET_KEY - a random string of 50 bytes or more.
    
        If you wish, use the program ./StandaloneTools/GenerateSecretKey.py
        for this.
        
9.  Populate the database with all the tables needed by going to the
main directory and running:

    ./manage.py migrate
    
    If all went well, your database should now have a bunch of tables
    starting with auth*, django*, and fpiweb*.
    
10. At this time the inventory system is ready to use.

    a.  To start the inventory system, use "run_inv" to start running it.
        
    b.  To test the inventory system, use "run_pytest" to run all the django
        unit tests and the pytests contained in the "tests" subdirectory.
        
    c.  An alternate way to run the tests is to run the following commands.
    
        source venv/bin/activate            (if this has not already been run)
        
        ./manage.py test
